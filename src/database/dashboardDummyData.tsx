      "This series is genuinely what Test cricket needed: Ben Stokes",
    newsContent:
      "England Test captain Ben Stokes hopes that his side's performances in recent times, particularly in the just-concluded Ashes, has managed to inspire a new generation to take up the sport. A hard-fought Ashes series came to an end on Sunday (July 31) with England managing to win the final Test to square the series 2-2. Even though England couldn't manage to regain the urn, parallels have been drawn to the epic showdown these two sides had in 2005. I think that over the last seven weeks, in particular, we've managed to drag a new audience towards Test cricket, Stokes said after the Oval Test. I think this series is genuinely what Test cricket needed. Two high-quality teams going at it toe-to-toe and the cricket has been something you couldn't take your eyes off. Every session has been its own game. We've been in control, then Australia have been in control. Everyone who's turned up to the games and bought a ticket has really enjoyed their days of cricket. That's all you can ask for as someone who pays money to come and watch an international sport. I really hope we've inspired a new generation. I look back to 2005 and what that series did for me as a young person, and I really hope there's someone who's the age I was then and says: 'That's what I want to be doing when I'm 21 or 22'.",

    newsContent:
      "Stuart Broad announced after the third day's play at The Oval that the the fifth Ashes Test will be his last, as he revealed his decision to retire from professional cricket, bringing the curtains down on a 17-year international career. Broad, one of only two pacers to cross 600 Test wickets, along with James Anderson, also became only the third bowler with 150+ Test wickets in the Ashes during the Oval Test. He will finish his career as the fifth-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket. Broad currently has 602 wickets in Test cricket and has the opportunity to add to his tally during Australia's chase, while he can also add to his runs tally of 3656 when England resume their second innings at 389/9. In a career spanning 167 Tests, Broad has so far picked up eight five wicket hauls and one ten wicket haul. He last played ODI cricket in 2016, finishing with 178 wickets while in 56 T20I matches, the last of which came in 2014, Broad picked up 65 wickets.",
